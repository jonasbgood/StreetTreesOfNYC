How the app works
-----------------

Trees are represented by the colored circles in the map. The color of each
circle represents the health status. The diameter of each circle roughly 
relates to the diameter of the tree in inch. 

The user can select trees from certain boroughs and certain health conditions.

By clicking on a single tree all available information for this tree is shown
in the table on the right.
